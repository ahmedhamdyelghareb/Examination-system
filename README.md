Construct an automated system that can perform online exams and build SQL database for such system.

 DB will help staff to see the following Reports:
 
•	Report that returns the students information according to Department No parameter.

•	Report that takes the student ID and returns the grades of the student in all courses.

•	Report that takes the instructor ID and returns the name of the courses that he teaches and the number of student per course.

•	Report that takes course ID and returns its topics  

•	Report that takes exam number and returns the Questions in it

•	Report that takes exam number and the student ID then returns the Questions in this exam with the student answers. 

Hints:
We use stored procedures to return data for each Report and Use Crystal Report for report design.
